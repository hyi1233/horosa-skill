## What This Repository Is

Xingque already had the hard parts: deep local algorithms, ephemeris-backed runtime behavior, rich AI export settings, and serious occult method coverage. `Horosa Skill` is the GitHub-first delivery surface that makes those capabilities usable by modern AI systems without turning the repo into a giant runtime dump.

This repository is built to solve five practical problems:

- Install a complete offline runtime from GitHub Releases.
- Expose real Xingque methods through `MCP` and a `JSON-first CLI`.
- Turn every method output into a high-signal, sectioned, machine-readable export contract.
- Persist every run, query, tool result, and final AI answer into a local retrieval-friendly record layer.
- Keep the repository lightweight and reviewable while shipping full runtime assets separately.

If the goal is “clone once, install once, and let AI call real Horosa methods locally on any machine,” this repo is designed for exactly that.

## What It Can Do Today

### High-level capability map

| Layer | What ships now | What that means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline runtime | macOS and Windows release assets installable from GitHub Releases | Users can run locally after install, including offline usage |
| AI surface | `MCP server` + `JSON-first CLI` + `ask / dispatch` orchestration | Claude, Codex, Open WebUI, and OpenClaw can all integrate cleanly |
| Method execution | `39` callable tools across charts, predictive work, occult domains, export tooling, and hover knowledge access | This is a real local capability surface, not just prompt glue |
| Output contract | Every supported method emits stable envelopes plus `export_snapshot` / `export_format` | Machines can consume outputs repeatedly without guesswork |
| Knowledge access | Local bundled Xingque hover knowledge for astrology, LiuReng, and Qimen | AI can ask for explanation layers as well as raw calculation layers |
| Local memory | SQLite + JSON artifacts + run manifest + answer write-back | Every invocation becomes a durable local record |
| Observability | Local JSONL traces with `trace_id` / `group_id` and run alignment | Operators can understand which run, tool, and artifact produced a failure |
| Evaluation | `run_full_self_check` plus `HorosaBench` benchmark cases | Quality is measured, not just assumed |
| Distribution model | Lightweight repository plus heavyweight release assets | Public history stays clean while runtime payloads stay complete |

### Feature pillars

- Real offline execution: no cloud divination API dependency after runtime install.
- Real tool surface: not prompt glue, but explicit schemas, explicit tools, and stable contracts.
- Real lifecycle storage: runs, artifacts, manifests, user questions, and final AI answers are persisted together.
- Real Xingque fidelity: outputs are cleaned toward Xingque export and hover-document style instead of loose summaries.
- Real GitHub packaging: lightweight public history, heavyweight runtime in Releases, product-like repo presentation.

### Explicit shipping exclusion

- `fengshui`

## Bundled Xingque Hover Knowledge Is Also Available

This repository now ships a local bundled knowledge layer for Xingque hover / popover content, so AI systems and users can read those explanations on demand without depending on the original app source tree.

Current bundled domains:

- Astrology: `planet`, `sign`, `house`, `lot`, `aspect`
- Da Liu Ren: `shen`, `house`
- Qimen Dunjia: `stem`, `door`, `star`, `god`

That means users can directly read:

- full hover explanations for chart planets, signs, houses, aspects, and lots
- full hover content for LiuReng earthly branch shen entries and house overlays
- full hover content for Qimen stems, doors, stars, and gods

Those reads are also persisted and queryable like any other tool call.

## Why The Output Layer Matters

Every tool returns a stable envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "qimen",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "input_normalized": {},
  "data": {},
  "summary": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "memory_ref": {},
  "error": null
}
```

Methods wired into the Xingque export system also attach:

- `data.export_snapshot`
- `data.export_format`
- `data.export_snapshot.snapshot_text`
- `data.export_snapshot.sections`
- `data.export_snapshot.selected_sections`

That means:

- AI systems do not need to reverse-engineer loose prose.
- Repeated calls keep the same semantic structure.
- `horosa_dispatch` also exposes export contracts for every child result.
- Stored JSON artifacts preserve the same cleaned structure.

## Local Data Management

By default, local records are stored under:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.horosa-skill/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/HorosaSkill/`

Each run can store:

- run metadata
- tool call records
- entity references
- JSON artifacts
- one `run manifest`
- original `query_text`
- `user_question`
- final `ai_answer_text`
- optional `ai_answer_structured`

This project already supports:

- `memory query`
  query history by tool, entity, or run id
- `memory show <run_id>`
  inspect one exact run end-to-end
- `memory answer --stdin`
  write the AI’s final answer back into an existing run

So the repository is not just an execution layer. It is also a local retrieval layer.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd horosa-skill
uv sync
uv run horosa-skill install
uv run horosa-skill doctor
uv run horosa-skill serve
```

Default MCP endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

For stdio-based clients such as Claude Desktop:

```bash
cd horosa-skill
uv run horosa-skill serve --transport stdio
```

## Fastest Usable Workflow

### 1. Install and verify the offline runtime

```bash
cd horosa-skill
uv sync
uv run horosa-skill install
uv run horosa-skill doctor
```

### 2. Let the dispatcher select methods

```bash
echo '{
  "query":"Please combine qimen, liureng, and chart methods to analyze the current state",
  "birth":{"date":"1990-01-01","time":"12:00","zone":"8","lat":"31n14","lon":"121e28"},
  "save_result": true
}' | uv run horosa-skill ask --stdin
```

### 3. Inspect one exact run

```bash
uv run horosa-skill memory show <run_id>
```

### 4. Attach the AI’s final answer

```bash
echo '{
  "run_id":"<run_id>",
  "user_question":"What does this imply for my career next?",
  "ai_answer":"The pattern is cautious first, then gradually upward.",
  "ai_answer_structured":{"trend":"up_later"}
}' | uv run horosa-skill memory answer --stdin
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### Dump the export registry

```bash
cd horosa-skill
uv run horosa-skill export registry
```

### Parse Xingque export text into structured JSON

```bash
echo '{
  "technique":"qimen",
  "content":"[起盘信息]\nparams\n\n[八宫]\nbody\n\n[演卦]\nbody"
}' | uv run horosa-skill export parse --stdin
```

### Run one atomic tool directly

```bash
echo '{"date":"1990-01-01","time":"12:00","zone":"8","lat":"31n14","lon":"121e28"}' \
  | uv run horosa-skill tool run chart --stdin
```

### Read bundled Xingque hover knowledge directly

```bash
echo '{"domain":"astro","category":"planet","key":"Sun"}' \
  | uv run horosa-skill knowledge read --stdin
```

```bash
echo '{"domain":"liureng","category":"shen","key":"子"}' \
  | uv run horosa-skill knowledge read --stdin
```

```bash
echo '{"domain":"qimen","category":"door","key":"休门"}' \
  | uv run horosa-skill knowledge read --stdin
```

### Run one Phase 2 local method

```bash
echo '{"taiyin":"巽","taiyang":"坤","shaoyang":"震","shaoyin":"震"}' \
  | uv run horosa-skill tool run tongshefa --stdin
```

### Run the unified dispatcher

```bash
echo '{
  "query":"Please analyze the current situation using qimen, liureng, and chart methods",
  "birth":{"date":"1990-01-01","time":"12:00","zone":"8","lat":"31n14","lon":"121e28"},
  "save_result": true
}' | uv run horosa-skill dispatch --stdin
```

## Runtime And Release Strategy

This repository intentionally separates three layers:

| Layer | Lives where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public repo layer | GitHub repository | code, docs, CLI, MCP, tests, examples, release scripts |
| Maintainer packaging input | `vendor/runtime-source/` | large local inputs required to build offline runtime releases |
| End-user runtime | `~/.horosa/runtime/current` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Horosa/runtime/current` | the actual installed runtime used for local execution |

This keeps the GitHub surface clean while still preserving full offline distribution.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`horosa-skill/`](./horosa-skill) | core Python package, CLI, MCP server, tests, examples, release scripts |
| [`docs/`](./docs) | runtime specs, coverage docs, release documentation, maintainer notes |
| [`vendor/`](./vendor) | local runtime packaging input area |

Useful documents:

- [Repo Layout](./docs/REPO_LAYOUT.md)
- [Offline Runtime Releases](./docs/OFFLINE_RUNTIME_RELEASES.md)
- [Runtime Manifest Spec](./docs/RUNTIME_MANIFEST_SPEC.md)
- [Algorithm Coverage](./docs/ALGORITHM_COVERAGE.md)
- [Vendored Runtime Sources](./vendor/README.md)

## Current Status

Already implemented:

- GitHub-first offline runtime install flow
- macOS and Windows runtime release assets
- local MCP server and JSON-first CLI
- full Xingque AI export registry and parser
- stable structured outputs across 39 callable tools
- bundled and queryable hover knowledge for chart, LiuReng, and Qimen
- dispatch-level child export contracts
- SQLite + JSON artifacts + run manifest data model
- AI answer write-back and retrieval workflow
- real fresh-clone validation from GitHub plus runtime reinstall

If you need a repository that turns Xingque into AI-callable infrastructure rather than a pile of loose scripts, this project is already operating in that direction.

## Quick Verification Checklist

If you want to prove to yourself that this is not just a polished shell, run the smallest serious verification path:

```bash
cd horosa-skill
uv sync
uv run horosa-skill install
uv run horosa-skill doctor
uv run pytest -q
uv run python scripts/run_benchmark.py
uv run python scripts/run_full_self_check.py --rounds 1
```

What matters in those results:

- `doctor` confirms the runtime is installed and reports `issues: []` once services are up
- `pytest` validates the engineering test suite
- `HorosaBench` validates routing, export parity, and knowledge reads
- `run_full_self_check` validates all callable tools, export contracts, persistence, retrieval, and dispatch aggregation

For a first-time evaluator, this says far more than “one tool happened to run once.”

## Release Integrity And Provenance

This repository now ships more than runtime packaging. It also includes the metadata and verification surfaces needed for auditable releases:

- runtime assets are distributed through GitHub Releases instead of bloating Git history
- `server.json` is present so MCP tooling can identify the server cleanly
- an SBOM generator is included for project dependencies and runtime-manifest-aware output
- traces, artifacts, run manifests, knowledge bundles, and export snapshots now carry versioning or provenance data
- release checks, benchmark checks, self-checks, README checks, and `server.json` validation are part of the engineering surface

Recommended follow-up documents:

- Operations: [`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md)
- Evaluation: [`docs/EVALUATION.md`](./docs/EVALUATION.md)
- Data contracts: [`docs/DATA_CONTRACTS.md`](./docs/DATA_CONTRACTS.md)
- MCP metadata: [`server.json`](./server.json)

## Recommended MCP / AI Integration Model

If you are wiring Horosa Skill into AI systems rather than treating it as a standalone CLI, this is the cleanest mental model:

1. `install + doctor`
2. attach the server through `stdio MCP`
3. add an HTTP / OpenAPI bridge only if a client cannot consume MCP directly

A practical split of responsibilities:

- `horosa_dispatch`: natural-language entrypoint
- atomic `tool run`: deterministic scripting and debugging
- `knowledge_read`: bundled Xingque hover-knowledge access
- `memory answer`: write the final AI answer back into the same run record

So the repository is not only a calculation surface. It also exposes:

- calculation
- export contracts
- bundled knowledge
- dispatch
- local memory
- observability

## Who This Repository Fits Best

This repository is especially strong for four groups:

- end users who want their own AI to call real Horosa methods locally
- advanced users who want every analysis persisted into queryable local memory
- maintainers who want a lightweight repo plus heavyweight release strategy
- researchers who care about tool routing, export contracts, hover-knowledge access, and process-level evaluation

If you are approaching it from a research perspective, start here:

- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [`docs/DATA_CONTRACTS.md`](./docs/DATA_CONTRACTS.md)

## FAQ / Boundary Notes

### Why is the release workflow not purely GitHub-hosted cloud build output?

Because the complete runtime still depends on maintained local runtime sources, platform runtimes, and packaging inputs. The goal is a lightweight public repository, but that does not remove the need for heavyweight, controlled runtime inputs during release assembly.

### Why do `export_snapshot` and `export_format` matter so much?

Because one of the core values of this project is making Xingque output stably consumable by AI systems. Without that contract layer, downstream retrieval, comparison, replay, and evaluation become fragile.

### Why keep both SQLite and JSON artifacts?

Because they serve different purposes:

- SQLite is the structured local index and query layer
- JSON artifacts are the durable, portable, diffable archival layer

### Why is `fengshui` still excluded?

Because the current public surface is intentionally limited to capabilities that are already headless, already verifiable offline, and already reliable enough to ship as a maintained local-first interface.

### What is the strongest quality signal in this repository?

Not the badge wall and not the screenshots. It is whether these four things remain true together:

- tools really run
- exports remain structurally stable
- results really persist and can be queried back
- benchmark and self-check continue to pass
